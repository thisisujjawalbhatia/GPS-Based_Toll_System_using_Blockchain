# Blockchain-Based Toll Application

This project is a blockchain-based toll application that leverages various technologies to provide a seamless toll collection experience. The application is built using the following technologies:

- **Ganache**: A personal blockchain for Ethereum development used for testing.
- **Strapi**: A headless CMS used for user authentication and toll booth geolocation.
- **Truffle**: A development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for Ethereum.
- **Ionic**: A framework for building cross-platform mobile applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js.
- **Web3.js**: A JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project Structure

- [Backend](./Backend): This folder contains the backend code that handles user authentication and toll booth geolocation using Strapi.
- [Truffle-SmartContract](./Truffle-SmartContract): This folder contains the smart contract code developed using Truffle.
- [Frontend](./Frontend): This folder contains the frontend code for the iOS and Android application built using Ionic and React.
- [Blockchain-API](./Blockchain-API): This folder contains the Express API that handles user transactions and interfaces with the blockchain using Web3.js.
